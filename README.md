CAPSTONE PROJECT:
This project is using the SHIPS(Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme) dataset. The goal is to predict when a hurricanes wind speed is going to randomly intensify. The Random Intensification of Hurricanes is defined as when a hurricane wind speed increases by over 35 mph within 24 hour time period. This happens in 10% of hurricanes.
RANDOM_INTENSIFICATION_HURRICANES_udacity.ipynb is the notebook that was used for the project.
This project is accompanied with a capstone_proposal and a 22 page pdf article about the matter.
The SHIPS dataset is also included and has a shape of 6767 X 46 A pdf of the analysis of the project is also included in the delivery.
